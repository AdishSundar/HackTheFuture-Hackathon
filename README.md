# HackTheFuture-Hackathon
This was a Sustainability Hackathon hosted by FreeTailHackers, a student-led organization at UT Austin.

For this hackathon, I created a Sprinkler Recommendation System in Python using OpenWeatherMap's API data that told
users a customized recommendation for when to turn on their sprinklers and for how long.
